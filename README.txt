Hello! This is an app that gets and displays local weather information.

It's really simple and the code is messy, at best. 

The API I used:
https://www.weatherapi.com/

Source for cloud icon:
https://www.flaticon.com/

Source for page loader:
https://redstapler.co/add-loading-animation-to-website/

Set up to open on local host and you're good to go!
